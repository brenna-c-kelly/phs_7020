**Instructions:** *You know that you can’t get any information whatsoever on breast density from claims data so you are exploring the BCSC data to assess if the breast density information captured will be ok to use. Your preliminary examination of the data will be focused on how many mammograms you could include in your study and what data limitations might be present. You will explore missingness in the registry data --- answering the question: Is there likely to be systematic bias in the missingness of a key factor – breast density – in the BCSC data.*

*This will require using two years of MEDPAR data.  Index hospitalizations will occur anytime during the two years.  This may lead to some bias in the rates (why??), but controlling for this is beyond the scope of the lab.*

*For DRG 127 (congestive heart failure) calculate readmission rates across the Glover Isle HRRs.*

*Examine the effect of age, sex, and race on the likelihood of readmission for CHF using a multilevel modeling approach to account for potential non-independence of observations within HRRs.  Explain the model Stata output as a short paragraph below your Stata results.*

*Write an abstract with the title: “Regional variation in readmission rates.” In the conclusion section, provide your speculation for why these rates differ. The deliverables for this exercise will be: Workflow diagram (1 point), Rcode/Rmd (2 points),  Abstract (approach, analysis, and content/written form)	(4 points).*

### Set-up

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(haven)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)
library(tableone)
library(corrplot)
library(RColorBrewer)
```

#### Workflow
![Workflow diagram.](/Users/brenna/Documents/School/Coursework/PHS 7020/exercise_4_workflow.png)

#### Reading in our data

```{r}
list.files("data/BCSC")

# reading in the clean datasets for comparison
re <- read_dta("data/BCSC/RiskEstimation1_USE THIS.dta")
rf <- read_dta("data/BCSC/RiskFactorsCombined.dta")

# reading in the data properly
rf_1 <- read.csv("data/BCSC/bcsc_risk_factors_summarized1_092020.csv")
rf_2 <- read.csv("data/BCSC/bcsc_risk_factors_summarized2_092020.csv")
rf_3 <- read.csv("data/BCSC/bcsc_risk_factors_summarized3_092020.csv")

rf <- rbind(rf_1, rf_2, rf_3)
rm(rf_1, rf_2, rf_3)

re_1 <- read_dta("data/BCSC/RiskEstimation1_USE THIS.dta")
re_2 <- read_dta("data/BCSC/RiskEstimation2.dta")

re <- re_1 #rbind(re_1, re_2)
rm(re_1, re_2)
head(re)

names(rf) <- tolower(names(rf))
names(re) <- tolower(names(re))

```

We'll clean both datasets to make them somewhat comparable to each other. This will be easier if we relabel the coded variables using the data dictionaries:
- [Risk Estimation Dataset Documentation](https://www.bcsc-research.org/datasets/rfdataset/dataset)
- [Risk Factors Dataset Documentation](https://www.bcsc-research.org/datasets/rf/documentation)

• examine (to the extent you are able) whether there seems to be any systematic bias in the missingness. Systematic missingness can arise in registry data from a variety of sources – to name a few: (1) Differences in ascertainment of information/data across registry sites. For example, some registries have systems in which it is automatically captured by the Radiology Information System software as part of the mammogram and some registries require the radiologist to enter density in a separate data file, which not all take/have the time to do, and some only capture in notes, which then requires NLP to extract; (2) Secular trends over time. Breast density was only recognized as an important component of breast cancer screening in the early 2000s, thus time for uptake of this knowledge, and clinical systems with which to capture it have evolved, with concomitant changes in data over time. Further, clinical definitions of breast density have changed over time, which may account for differing distributions of the density categories in the two datasets.

• how will you examine for systematic bias due to breast density missingness?  Certainly, you could do post hoc sensitivity analyses, fancy multiple imputation methods, etc. But for this assignment, let’s start with the basics ---- compare factors for women with known breast density to those same factors for women with missing breast density

Create the following tables:
• Table 1: Distribution of breast density by categories and missingness in each dataset
• Table 2: Breast density missing/non-missing (as the columns) in relation to other factors that are comparable across the two datasets (as the rows)

```{r}

table(re_rf$density, re_rf$dataset) # count
prop.table(table(re_rf$density, re_rf$dataset)) # distribution


vars <- re_rf |>
  select(-c("density_missing", "dataset")) |>
  names()

tab1 <- CreateTableOne(vars, c("density_missing", "dataset"), re_rf)
tab1

```


### Abstract: Regional variation in readmission rates. 
**Introduction.** Missingness is a common problem in medical data, even in registries, and prevents us from performing many types of analyses. There are a variety of approoaches to remedy missingness, but prior to addressing the issue we need to understand the source of missingness — in particular, whether there is random or systematic structure to the missingness. \n
**Methods.** We combine data from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium for risk estimation and risk factors. Missingness in breast density is of primary interest. Comparable variables between both datasets are used to combine the data, and potential structure in missingness if also explored within datasets. \n
**Conclusions.** There is systematic structure to breast density missingness in both datasets. In particular, the missingness decreases over time in the risk factors dataset, when people became more aware that breast density was a risk factor. Missingness in the risk estimate dataset appears to be associated with interaction with the healthcare system. Likely, people who had health insurance and access to medical care were more likely to get density examinations.
